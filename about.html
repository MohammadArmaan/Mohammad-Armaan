            Welcome to my world! I'm Mohammad Armaan, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student with a burning enthusiasm for web development.
            As I journey through the realms of technology, my heart finds solace in the intricacies of code and the endless possibilities it presents.
            <br><br>
            
            Driven by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and innovation, I'm dedicated
             to honing my skills and exploring the ever-evolving landscape of web development.
              With each line of code, I strive to craft experiences that not only captivate but also inspire.
            <br><br>

            Beyond academia, I embrace the freedom of freelancing, where I unleash my creativity and tackle
             exciting projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. With a blend of ambition and
              determination, I'm on a quest to turn dreams into reality and shape the digital world one pixel at a time.
            <br><br>

            Join me on this exhilarating journey as I weave my aspirations into the fabric of technology,
             leaving a mark that resonates with creativity, passion, and endless possibilities.</p>
